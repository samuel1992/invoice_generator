# INVOICE GENERATOR
A simple system to create invoices to charge your clients.

## TODO
- add sqlite as database (have to see where to store it in a safe way, maybe in the same folder initially)
- interfacing to add products, clients, bank accounts, etc
    - list products
    - list clients 
    - list bank accounts
    - add products
    - add clients
    - add bank accounts
    - create invoices passing the client, products and bank account
- maybe a setup to install it in way to be a command line tool
